# Interdisciplinary Research Methods in Computational Biology

This project was part of the course "Interdisciplinary Research Methods in Computational Biology".
I made a comparative analyis of protein secondary structure protein using both Deep Learning and using the so-called Baum-Welch algorithm, which is an Expectation-Maximization (EM) Algorithm used specifically on Hidden Markov Models.

Everything was implemented from scratch in the corresponding jupyter Notebook.

More on the background of the Baum-Welch algorithm can be found in the pdf.
